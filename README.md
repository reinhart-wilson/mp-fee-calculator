# Marketplace Calculator

Marketplace Calculator is a simple Flutter web app for estimating the final price of products posted to popular Indonesian marketplaces, such as Tokopedia/TikTok Shop and Shopee. With constantly raising fees, it's important that sellers price their items correctly to avoid further loss.

This project was created primarily with learning [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) and [Riverpod](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod) in mind.

## üß† How it works

- The app reads fee and category data from JSON under `/assets/data/`.
- Fees and categories are represented as nested objects (`CategoryNode`).
- The calculator supports both **flat fees** and **multiplier-based fees**.
- For gross calculation, a **binary search** is used to find the correct price that yields the desired net value ‚Äî efficient, flexible, and avoids hardcoding special limits.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)
- [Riverpod](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod)

## üß© Planned Improvements

- **Fee group exclusivity** ‚Äî certain fees belonging to the same group (e.g., *Star* vs *Non-Star* on Shopee) will automatically deselect each other when selected.  
- **Automatically checks fees** - mandatory fees will be automatically selected upon load.
- **Mall/Official Store support** ‚Äî not currently supported, since it requires reworking how fee data is structured and processed.
